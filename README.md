# Algebra

In my research work, I often encounter some calculation problems, but I can't find a program available on the Internet, or it is difficult to find.

This folder is used to share some such programme related to algebra, with a focus on python and sagemath.

######IDE

Sagemath 9.6, python 3.11

1.My thesis is ``A study of the Matrix-Tree Theorem''. After studying ``Spectra of quaternion unit gain graphs'' , I felt that the Matrix-Tree Theorem could be generalized to quaternion unit groups. However, I found that the moore determinant of the quaternion unit matrix does not satisfy the commutative law, so I discussed it with Dr. Bian, and finally came up with these three programs to verify the commutativity of the determinant of the quaternion identity matrixï¼šmyMooreDetofQuat2, myMooreDetofQuat3 and myMooreDetofQuat4.
